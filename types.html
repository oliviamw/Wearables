        <p>So what kinds of wearables are there? Well, wristbands and wristwatches are the most popular since people are used to wearing bracelets and normal watches on their wrists. So this isn’t a big step to the unknown. The only thing that is a bit different is that can synchronize it with your phone or/and with your computer. You get all your messages, phone calls and notifications to the display and also tracking every step and every move of your day. Also some of the products come with a heart rate monitor, GPS, your burnt calories, floors you’ve taken instead of taking the elevator. But to keep it normal, these bands and watches also have the function of showing the time and date.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel2v">
        <p>Since many people wear prescription glasses and also there are people just wear glasses for fashion, they could also wear smart glasses instead. So these glasses can be worn by anyone, except for people that do not have a nose, for example Voldemort. These glasses are very useful for navigating around a city creating an augmented environment. For instance the glasses from Icis, have a built in camera, speaker, microphone, battery and a circuit board. These glasses have three modes: one for just being at home (normal mode), one for being active and one for driving to shut off all notifications to concentrate on driving.</p>

      <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel3v">
        
        <p>Jewelry for example rings, bracelets and necklaces are also used for tracking and receiving notifications and calls. These products have the most attention from women. Women can combine their fashion with technology. The jewelry mostly do not have a display like most of the wristbands do, but you acquire enough information as you need to know what kind of a notification you are receiving. Also an interesting factor is helping the people by wearing this is, how it can help them. For instance by ripping of the smart bracelet will contact a specific person when you are in danger, which is important if you live in a dangerous city. Also the jewelry can have a necklace which monitors the sleep quality and turns in to a clip on at night.</p>

      <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel4v">
        <p>Clip-ons are a very useful tracker since you do not have to have anything around your wrist or on your body. You can attach them on your bag, coat or whatever you are wearing in the moment. You might even make a necklace out of it for the day, and at night you can clip it on your pajamas. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel5v">
        <p>Earbuds and headphones can be smart wear, too. For example, there are earphones that can save up to 4 GB worth of songs in themselves. They are completely wireless. So if you touch your bud, you can start playing music or answer a call. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel6v">
        <p>When you think of smart clothing, you probably think of sport wear, for example woven in conductive thread that helps measure your body temperature, heart rate and so on. But there are also different smart clothing than that. Insoles for your shoes can also be smart, tracking your steps and also regulating the temperature of the insoles themselves. Baby monitoring also comes up. Parents, who are constant worrying about their infant child, can purchase smart clothing and get notifications on their cell phone when their child woke up, stopped breathing or just for listing in if something is happening. </p>

      <div class="tabs-panel" id="panel7v">
        <p>Implants are important in medicine. For instance, if you get an implant in your hip, you can synchronize it with your phone and share it with your doctor to measure joint loads, the temperature while walking and doing sports and, getting feedback on friction of the joint itself. This is also possible for shoulders, spine and knee.</p>
